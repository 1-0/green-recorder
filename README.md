## About

A simple yet functional desktop recorder for Linux systems. Built using Python, GTK+ 3 and ffmpeg. Currently it supports recording audio and video on almost all Linux interfaces. However, **Wayland support (GNOME session) is expected to be added soon**.

The following formats are currently available: **avi**, **mp4**, **flv**, **wmv** and **nut**. You can stop the recording process easily by middle-clicking the recording icon in the notifications area.
