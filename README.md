# Green Recorder

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/green-project/green-recorder/master/Green%20Recorder.png)

A simple yet functional desktop recorder for Linux systems. Built using Python, GTK+ 3 and ffmpeg. Currently it supports recording audio and video on almost all Linux interfaces. However, Wayland support (GNOME session) is expected to be added soon.

The following formats are currently available: avi, mp4, flv, wmv and nut. You can stop the recording process easily by middle-clicking the recording icon in the notifications area.

The program is released under GPL 3. For contact: mhsabbagh[at]outlook.com.
